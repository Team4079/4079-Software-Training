# Driver Station

Driverstation could refer to two things. 

1. Driverstation could be the physical device that allows you to carry the laptop, joysticks, and any other necessary components for driving a robot. (We really need one)
2. Driverstation could also refer to the software that allows you to control the robot. This software is called FRC Driverstation and is available for download on the FRC website.

## Driverstation Software

We will be focussing on the driverstation software. Simply, this allows you to control your robot through your laptop.
The main features of the driverstation software are:

- **Robot Communication**: Allows you to communicate with the robot including enabling and disabling it (with enter key).
- **Joystick** and **Gamepad Control**: Allows you to connect joysticks and check their inputs.
- **Robot Code**: Allows you to see whether the robot has code on it.
- **Robot Information**: Allows you to see the robot information such as battery voltage, connection status, etc.
- **Robot Logs**: Allows you to see the robot logs and diagnose potential issues.
- **Robot Configuration**: Allows you to run autonomous, teleop, or test modes.

> **Note**
>
> Phoenix Pro requires you to use the FRC Driverstation to get the team number.
> Otherwise, it will give you errors for being unlicensed.
