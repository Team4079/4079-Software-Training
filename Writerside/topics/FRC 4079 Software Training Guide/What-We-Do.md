# What We Do

(Will update this I promise)

## Our Mission
The goal of the software team is to essentially tell the robot what to do. We tell it when, where, how, etc to do absolutely everything. 

### We want to turn our robot from this:

### To something more like this:

## How We Do This
Through code that we write and is compiled, the robot can understand us and do what we tell it to do. However, being part of software does not just mean code code code. 
You have to work with the rest of the team, use external software, and test the code on the robot.

We will get into the specifics of all this in our guide. Many of the things we do however, are best learned with a current software member such as using Phoenix Tuner. 

Hope this guide is useful for you and we can keep this going! \^o^/ -Shawn G.
