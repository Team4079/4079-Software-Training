# What We Do

(Will update this I promise)

## Our Mission
The goal of the software team is to essentially tell the robot what to do. We tell it when, where, how, etc to do absolutely everything. 

## How We Do This
Through code that we write and is compiled, the robot can understand us and do what we tell it to do.
