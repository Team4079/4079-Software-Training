> This tutorial helps you learn about subsystems, commands, and the overall structure of FRC code. While we may not use tank drive in competition, it provides an excellent introduction to our coding processes.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a tank drive system using WPILib and command-based programming. This guide is designed for beginners to FRC software development.

### Prerequisites
* Basic Java knowledge
* WPILib installed (VSCode with WPILib extension or IntelliJ with FRC extension)

### Learning Outcomes
* Implement a functional tank drive subsystem
* Understand the command-based programming framework
* Learn how subsystems, commands, and other project components interact
* Build foundation knowledge for creating more complex FRC subsystems

## What is a Tank Drive?

A tank drive is a drive train configuration that uses powered wheels on both sides of the robot (typically 3 wheels per side). This setup allows the robot to:
- Move forward and backward
- Turn by running wheels at different speeds
- Maneuver with precise control

### Creating a New WPILib Project

1. **Open WPILib VSCode and access the WPILib menu**

   Click the WPILib logo in the top right corner.

3. **Configure your project**
  
   a. Select: Template > Java > Command Robot

   ![config project.png](config project.png)

   b. Choose a base folder location

   c. Name your project "Tank Drive"

   d. Enter your team number (4079 for Quantum Leap)

## Creating the Tank Drive Subsystem

> **Tip**
>
> The generated project includes extra code that we won't need. We'll remove unnecessary components to focus on the tank drive implementation.
