# Tank Drive Tutorial

> The code for this guide will be available at (will hopefully be up soon) [Tank Drive Code](https://mentorprogrammedrobots.com).
>
> This guide is a useful to learn how subsystems, commands, and overall how FRC code works. We will likely never use a tank drive again, but this should give you a good introduction on our coding processes.

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to code a tank drive. This tutorial is intended for those who are starting with FRC software. It assumes you have basic knowledge of:

* Java
* FRC stuff I think

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

* Code a basic tank drive
* Understand the role of subsystems, commands, and the rest of the files in a standard project
* Be ready to code more FRC subsystems!!!

## Before you start

* Make sure you install a code editor and WPILib (Either WPILib VSCode or FRC extension for intelliJ)

## Creating a Project

To get started, {(the first thing your user should do)}.

1. {(Write the step here. Use a verb to start.)}

    {(Explanatory text)}

    {(Optional: Code sample or screenshot that helps your users complete this step)}

    {(Optional: Result)}

2. {(Write the step here. Use a verb to start.)}
  
   a. {(Substep 1)}

   b. {(Substep 1)}

## Summary

{(Use this section to summarize what the user learned in the tutorial.)}

In this tutorial, you learned how to:

* Summary point 1
* Summary point 2
* Summary point 3..

## Next steps

{(Use this section to share links to related tutorials, videos, or other documentation)}.

Consider completing some other common tasks using {(feature)}:
