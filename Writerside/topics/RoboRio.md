# RoboRio

The RoboRIO is the main processor on every FRC robot. It performs various roles such as

+ Runs all our code
+ Has ports for DIO and PWM
+ Start of CAN bus
+ Connects to our radio
+ Probably many more I am missing

As you can see, it performs many roles and is crucial. 

Every season, new images for the RoboRio will come out and need to be flashed.
