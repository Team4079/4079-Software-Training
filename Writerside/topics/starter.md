# FRC 4079 Software Training Guide

## Our Mission
We created this software training guide in order to have all the information we find valuable for all our software members to know for FRC 4079. Even though this guide tries to teach many skills, this should not replace actual experience. Rather, this guide should make all the intimidating software understandable after looking through the guide.

FRC software is something that takes time so please understand this especially without much programming experience. Stick with it, and you will be creating autonomous routines in no time. Feel free to start wherever you feel most comfortable, but we highly suggest looking through it in order, as that would make learning this simpler. 

If you have any suggestions for our material, please let us know. We are always open to how we can make it easier for newer members to learn this. This guide will likely keep evolving so this is extremely important to keep it going and for this resource to stay relevant. 

Please note: this guide is FRC centered, so many language specific or other niche topics that are not commonly used in FRC may not be covered. For example, this guide is not to teach you everything you need to know in java. There are plenty of guides for that (we highly suggest you learn some java or kotlin), but we will do our best to explain the most important concepts of it. 

We are also more than happy to explain anything that you may not understand. Ask any of the current software members, and we will make sure you understand the material.

## Quick start guide
The guide is divided into important aspects of FRC Software. Each of these will have guides explaining specific aspects of the certain concept. We suggest you go in order as that is what we believe would be best for people new to FRC Software.
