# Drivetrain

## What is a Drivetrain?

A drivetrain is the base of each FRC robot amd is what drives and allows each robot to move. 
There are two main types of drivetrains which are tank and swerve.

## Tank

A tank drive uses two sets of wheels on each side in a vertical fashion.

Tank drives are generally more powerful than a tank drive at the sacrifice of mobility and agility. This is because it can only move forward, backward, and turn.

## Swerve

A swerve drive uses four wheels that can rotate 360 degrees. This allows the swerve drive to move in all directions and turn at the same time.
