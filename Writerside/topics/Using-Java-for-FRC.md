# Using Java for FRC

**Author:** Brandon Jun  
**Class:** Absolute Monkey

## Introduction

As of 2025, Java and Kotlin are the two main language 4079 uses.
The main languages of FRC teams are typically C++, Java, and Python,
however is not only limited to these three, which we'll discuss later
on. The reasons why we don't use C++ is because it does not give us
the benefit that we want for such a low-level language, and for Python
the language is simply too inefficient for our robot code, making Java
the best and most sufficient middle language for us.

## Context Behind Java

Since Java is the more primary language for 4079, knowing Java
and the object-oriented system behind it is essential for starting with
FRC software, and the best way to learn is knowledge and exposure. There
are a plethora of online resources to learn the basics of Java, and simple 
projects to understand the language to better prepare for FRC software.

## Resources:
### 1. www.w3schools.com

w3schools is a great resource for learning Java, as it provides a simple 
and easy-to-understand guide for beginners. It covers all the basics of Java, 
from variables and data types to loops and arrays and includes advanced libraries 
of Java. The website also offers interactive examples and exercises to help you 
practice your skills.

### 2. www.codecademy.com

Codeacademy is another available resource for learning Java. It offers a 
more detailed however limited guide for beginners. This course is also more 
narrowed down on the order of how you learn Java, and is not the highest 
recommended resource from 4079, but is available for those who want to try it.

### 3. APCSA (AP Computer Science A, 10th Grade)

Most if not all 4079 Software members have taken or are taking APCSA, however
is NOT a requirement to join the team. APCSA is NOT the best, however is an ok 
foundation for learning the syntax and basic fundamentals of Java.
